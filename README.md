Touchless Control

Because touching keyboards is sooo 2023.
Welcome to Touchless Control, the future of interacting with your computer — using nothing but hand gestures. Built with Python and the magic of Streamlit, this project lets you control your system like a wizard at Hogwarts. No wand required, just your hand.

What is this sorcery?

It’s a gesture-based control system that replaces your mouse with your majestic hand movements. You point, you click, you scroll, you drag — all without touching a thing. It’s like having J.A.R.V.I.S., but without Tony Stark’s bank account.

Built With

Python
OpenCV and MediaPipe (for detecting your hand like a boss)
PyAutoGUI (to move your mouse without a mouse)
Streamlit (so it actually looks good when you show it to your friends)

Features

Mouse Control (your hand is the cursor now)
Click and Drag
Scroll

Disclaimer

Touchless Control does not make you a Jedi, but it’s a good start.
Use responsibly. Do not attempt to scroll using both hands while dancing.
Made with ❤️, caffeine, and a lot of waving at the camera.
